Football Pitch Reservation Site - README

This is my Football Pitch Reservation Site, created for my 4th-grade final paper. The website is designed to help people easily book football pitches for games, practice sessions, or fun matches with friends. 
- Users can browse a list of available pitches, check their availability by selecting a date and time, and reserve a spot with just a few clicks.
- My goal was to create a tool that makes planning football games quick, stress-free, and enjoyable for everyone.

- The site supports different payment methods to make booking convenient. Users can pay for their pitch reservations using credit or debit cards.
- Allowing users to secure a pitch in under a minute with a simple and clear booking form.
- The website is built with responsive design, meaning it works perfectly on any device, whether itâ€™s a computer tablet, or smartphone.
- The layout adjusts automatically to fit different screen sizes, so users can book a pitch from anywhere, anytime, with a smooth and user-friendly experience.
- This project showcases my skills in web development, problem-solving, and creating something useful for football fans.

Thank you for exploring my work!
